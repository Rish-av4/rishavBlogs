To justify what one feels, what one intro & restrospects, what one experiences and what are the reasons that keeps him/her going parallel with this notorious and difficult world, at that moment one begins to write something. At times that become prose, that become poetry, that become a way of living. And one is never alone in this journey of sad and happy. Below is the order of poems, they are presented as.   

- Stone & River.
- The Change.
- Things -- as they were.
- The Girl.

## Stone & River


It is the stone that cries, </br>
When a never ending river passes by.
A stone,</br> 
Half dipped in the transparent hues and blues of water.</br> 
Often worries and coldly says:</br>
--whether will I stay put?</br>
Is my root foundation strong enough? </br>
Or I &apos;d be stemmed away?!</br>
Like miniscule playing pebbles.</br>

And</br> 
For separation, it cries.</br>
For moving on in the trajectory of life, it cries.</br> 
For elevated change it cries.</br>

As</br>
The stone has its own principles.</br>
A fuddy-duddy one&apos;s they say.</br> 
Which needs to understand ‚Äî</br>
That,</br> 
Has a river ever halted for somebody? </br>
For anybody per se ?</br>
A fat no;</br> 
Never would suffice.</br>

It has turbulence, pace and wholesome behavior of its own.</br> 
Stopping by is vague in its setting.</br>
It flows and traverses obstructions on and on.</br> 

So</br>
Go with the flow is wise or vice?</br>
A stone has to stop crying;</br>
Or not? It&apos;s not nice.</br>
Things will change.</br>
Would be justified at times.</br> 

See, Such is life.</br> 


## The Change

Come let us construct a new globe once again.</br> 
And incinerate the lively baggage which endures gruesome pain.</br> 
If not God, atleast let us become a good heart one;</br>
With no abject demarcations, marginalized , divides & fear none.</br>

Let that world not be round,</br>
Be it plain yet having a cubical ground.</br> 
A fictional place pouncing to terms and sudden reality,</br> 
Not a pinch of subjugated superiority and wretched inequality.</br> 
Where all heads-hearts are doppelgangers by soul,</br>
Love is all it takes is a principle:</br>
takes not two but all to tango in a merry ball with zero brawls;</br>

Nothing as a sluggish paranoia exists out there,</br> 
Only present stays , future is obsolete and cared for less there;</br>
Where happy couples sit by the sea sparkle,</br>
Aim high, observe star-light and discuss life that shines and dazzle.</br>

Contains chapter which withholds no politics in deeds,</br>
whereby innocence is the only creed.</br>
Where Juliet won&apos;t die by happenchance, folks pray.</br> 
As she was Romeo&apos;s to stay.</br> 
A nascent energy that bounds all together,</br> 
Where negative things dies and gets tethered.</br> 
Come let us make one.</br>


## Things -- as they were

Things have changed, so the realism.</br> 
Fakeness is on, and this everlasting materialism.</br>
That childish naivety seems lost on earth. 
Booming up is coolness, so sadly simplicity gains no worth.</br> 

Days were when we sail paper boats and flew planes in the air.</br> 
Grownups are we and now ain't one care.</br>
Those reminiscences of past digs deep in the heart.</br>
Then staying in present does nothing but hurt.</br>


Those rhymes of kindergarden&apos;s , peeing in shorts.</br>
Playing at swings, racing when starts beating mom.</br> 
Spending half a day out home, no tention and hurry.</br> 
And today we do nothing but worry, worry and worry.</br> 

Suddenly yet time has taken its toll,</br> 
That hilarious laughs and whisperings turned into yay&apos;s & LOL.</br>
Bygone are those old walls of innocence and naughty vibes,</br> 
Only if I could turn back the clock God, thy help us, don&apos;t we come in your tribe?</br>

Now has taught us to live in present and enjoy the moment,</br>
Or will become a victim to remorse and torment.</br>
I see I&apos;m short of words now,</br>
And just quote to life, hey you&apos;re like so damn "wow".üòÇ</br>

##  The Girl

She and her--</br>
Sick by heart? </br>
Somehow I was.</br>
Not anymore they were.</br>
Her pinkish par alcohol driven eyes have slayed me much ;</br>
A diva of substance; </br>
A fancy bred;</br>
A lovely-wanted pain in the head;</br>
An Apple of eyes;</br>
Ah! beauty, never have I witnessed as such.</br>

Her razzling-dazzling hairs so lustrous;</br>
Winish-red lips making smiles in cluster.</br>
Poetic soulful words she utter,</br>
(At a suited distance but)</br> 
Cut all my heart&apos;s clutter.</br>
Exchanging a word or two with her, </br>
Yes, a hardwired deep desire;</br>
But holy O&apos; my, no courage I muster.</br> 

Indeed a blissful day came,</br> 
And yet nighty-night was not to be blamed.</br> 
She caught my gaze,</br> 
By a moonlit shining maze;</br>
Then she walked through that laid rug,</br> 
Stood by my side;</br>

*Sighs*</br>

Gave this nobody a tightened hug.</br>
That, embrace, longed for a relative time.</br> 
Happened to be seventh heaven or a cloud of nine.</br>
Thus, after all this, she was all mine.</br> 
A paen of emotions, I then narrated to her.</br>
A heartfelt lay she sang,</br> 
Our arms in-around, there was no pang.</br>



## A Brief Evening Time

Beautiful much is her street in the evening, so serene is eye of the heaven that&apos;s slowly heading towards nadir. Wafting birds Are chirping soundly. Itsy-bitsy seems work now. A sense of involvement she observed.
