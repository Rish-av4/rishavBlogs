## Hope

sweet slumber is in the air,</br> 
from where,</br> 
stifling sun along much shine seems fresh,</br>
feels warm and precisely clear.</br> 

The day unfolds,</br> 
collected hope it beholds. </br>
A hope, </br>
that is entangled in fears, </br>
weaved with desperate worries and pathetic cries,</br> 
yet which became stronger,</br>
surviving toil and tears. </br>
Dapper cap is what it wears. </br>
a hope, in conditions like this, </br>
still choses to exist. </br>
Surpassing any fluke of an exit,</br>
persist. </br>
A hope that still exists. </br>

It knows no bar, it keeps the happy, keeps the sad. </br>
none left like door ajar. </br>
As it adds value to life. </br>
Hope: It's a good thing; goes the saying,</br>
which penetrates misery, kills the bleakness,</br>
in a way that resonates with slaying. </br>

Tomorrow is supposed to be fated, </br>
Ah atleast excited, when hope is on. </br>
It is everything, for one and for all 
who rejoices and hops into hope. </br>
Even for lovers who elope, </br>
for farmers who crop</br>
so on and so forth. </br>
Hope has an utter significance,</br>
being possible, plausible and one of its kind. </br>

## Remembrance

How beautiful is that ,</br>
when a peculiar smell reminds you of a place,</br>
a flower enlightens you about seasons,</br>
a taste tells you about the time gone,</br>
a song of old dances you to nostalgia,</br>
a feel makes you remember,</br>
an instance aware you to introspect,</br>
a victory embraces you with pride of the past,
a smile happens for no reason,</br>
a defeat engulfs you with sadness,</br>
you already have experienced.</br>

when a naive talk of the past enlarges our happiness,</br>
an old picture and video come our way,</br>
a road we walked through has changed all along,</br>
a small mud house is a justified aesthetic.</br>

How beautiful will it be ,</br>
when curiosity in this poem raises a bar.</br>

## The Void

Of late, he hates --</br>
the gist of all his fears</br>
but still he suits himself up,</br>
for understanding the concrete depths in them.</br>
In depths, they say, the meaning is to be found.</br>
about the unknown dominance</br>
that perpetuates the limits of our being.</br>

The fear,</br>
which is directly proportional with the torturous time.</br>
The anxious fury burdens with anytime anxiety</br>
and the stitch doesn't save nine.</br>
The reasons and explanations are but none.</br>
He tries to divert his nerves,</br>
gets himself occupied with a few waiting ambitions.</br>
but yet he doesn't.</br>
the short breathlessness still suffocates,</br>
not an agora, nor a claustro in phobias -</br>
but a kind that never vacates.</br>

The late hours of dusk scares to its best,</br>
he juxtaposes and think</br>
and he concludes no cure, consciously observes :</br>
the sky above turned dark from pale azure.</br>
the mental temperament seduces like never before.</br>
he's still out in the dark,</br>
seeking depths by each limb.</br>

Something still by demeanor,</br>
small by skull - he sees,</br>
known for the abrupt vigilance it keeps;</br>
a nocturnal bird but vague it appears</br>
a burrowing owl resting within a yard it is</br>
and for fear he prepares.</br>
Omen or is it a call from heavens beyond?</br>
Has it come for the rescue?</br>
Or for me?</br>

the owl flies to and fro, preys upon the devious beings.</br>
the beings, who have ventured out to absorb the boy,</br>
frighten and eat him to the gut.</br>
Then the owl</br>
returns back to the bamboo-top it hails</br>
It preserves and contains the boy, who knows not.</br>
It scares him but so does it care and protect.</br>
It is the depth he has craved to master in his lows.</br>

The evils which are -- not,</br>
which are but unseen.</br>
the trepidation of the long is gone,</br>
the sole state of being is new and nourished.</br>
thus, the fresh winds have now blown.</br>

## Her Muse

she finds meaning in a word</br>
but she doesn't know</br>
words are the men who often bow</br>
to present their promising nuptial vows</br>

she feels flattered and struck in awe </br>
as if she is the symphony</br>
upon whom the youth and their prime falls like no</br>

hers is a charm to claim</br>
infectious smile to rather blame. </br>
say - easy going gestures to name</br>
her wrath teaches to seep in</br>
the things </br>
and forget about the old obsolete sins.</br>
